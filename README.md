## Problem

This was given as a hackathon at the School of Code.  We were divided into small groups and given a brief to build an MVP using React and Next.js.  Although we had been learning and using React for the previous week or so, Next.js was completely new to use and we had not had any tuition on it at all.  The idea was to simulate a real world environment to mirror the dynamic nature of a developer's life.  All the activities (from conception to presentation) took place over a 2-day period.

The objectives were to:
- learn and apply Next.js to build a functional prototype
- understand and demonstrate the benefits of Next.js over vanilla React
- develop an app highlighting key Next.js features, like server-side rendering and file-based routing
- deliver a functional MVP within the strict 2-day timeframe

After some discussion, we decided that we wanted to build an app that would gather data about the solar system from an api or two and present the data in an educational format.  The interface would allow us to explore the file-based routing system in Next.js as we presented information about each planet.  We also wanted a fun interface where a user could click on an image of the planet to get further information.
